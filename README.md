# Mazes for Programmers

This is my work-through of Jamis Buck's fantastic book 'Mazes for Programmers: Code Your Own Twisty Little Passages'. This is by far the most fun I've had coding since getting into 3D stuff as a kid!

At the time of writing I am working through chapter 5 and will upload the work as I go. I intend to add a /homework folder to try out some of Jamis's suggestions for personal projects.

Reproduced with the kind permission of the author. These files are the work of Jamis Buck, though I have restructured the folders and made a few changes after running the rubocop static analysis tool over them. An apology to American readers, but I'm afraid that - as a Brit - I've Anglisised many of the names in the original text!
