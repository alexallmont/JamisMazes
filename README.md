# Mazes for Programmers

This is my work whilst reading Jamis Buck's fantastic book 'Mazes for Programmers: Code Your Own Twisty Little Passages'. The book is great fun to code along to so I wanted to share the source code per chapter along with my attempts at the exercises.

This is reproduced with the kind permission of the author. The files in /book are the work of Jamis Buck with a few changes after running rubocop static analysis. Some of the code has been Anglisised.
